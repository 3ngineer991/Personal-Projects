This project is a series of TicTacToe games I made.

I started with "TicTacToe.py", a basic 2 player tic tac toe game where you needed to enter coordinates in order to play.

I then moved on to "Noughts_and_Crosses.py" where I updated to UI to allow input from your keyboard (WASD and space bar) to control a curser and select a placement. I also imported "TicTacToe.py" so I did not have to recreate code I had already written.

However sometimes life gets lonely and you do not have a friend to play with, so I made an AI to play tic tac toe with me using the files "TicTacToeAI.py" and "TicTacToeWithAI.py". I also built a trainer that randomly chose spots to play so I could play against a mature robot, "TicTacToeTrainerForAI.py".
